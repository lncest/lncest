<h1 align="center"> DO NOT INTERACT </h1>
</p><p align="center" dir="auto"> Kins of Caesar Zeppeli, Risotto Nero, Trish Una, Noriaki Kakyoin [JJBA], Shanks [One Piece] or Muzan Kibutsuji [KNY]
</p><p align="center" dir="auto"> Anyone under 18, I am an adult, I don't see a reason for me to befriend minors.
</p><p align="center" dir="auto"> If you cause or start drama. I don't care about any of your petty issues, go find someone who does.

<h1 align="center"> BEFORE YOU INTERACT </h1> 
</p><p align="center" dir="auto"> I don't mind anyone sitting with me. I won't yell at you for it like others do. I prefer you ask first, but it's not required.
</p><p align="center" dir="auto"> I am usually up for chatting, but I get tired of conversing easily, I will let you know when I wish to stop.
</p><p align="center" dir="auto"> I'm AFK or Off-Tab often, if you try to speak to me and I don't respond, I did not see your message.
</p><p align="center" dir="auto"> I am typically a very friendly person but if you are wrongfully harassing me/my friends/ or someone else, I will not hesitant to confront you, it's ridiculous you can't play a game without making others miserable. 
</p><p align="center" dir="auto"> I use my hide list. Don't bother me with getting your friend to beg me to unhide you, I won't. 
</p><p align="center" dir="auto"> 'Default Ponies' get hidden for 15mins or 24hrs. It's not personal, just seems weirdos walk around in the default skin.
